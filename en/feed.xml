<h3 id="️-layout-overview">🗺️ Layout Overview</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyMap.png" alt="Simplified floor map of HANABaby Adventure World" /><br />
<em>(This is a simple hand-drawn reference map — not perfectly to scale,<br />
but it shows the layout from the <strong>Admission Desk</strong> at the entrance<br />
to the active play zone, pretend play zone, rest area, and party room.)</em></p>

<p>As of 2025, the playground is divided into two main sections —<br />
the <strong>left side for active play</strong> and the <strong>right side for pretend play</strong>.<br />
Down the hallway, you’ll find the <strong>rest area, restroom, and party room</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-active-play-zone">🎠 Active Play Zone</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyFakeSand.png" alt="Fake sand play area" />
<img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyMazeNBallpit.png" alt="Ball pit and maze structure" />
<img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyTrampoline.png" alt="Trampoline area" /></p>

<p>The left section is where kids can burn off their energy.<br />
It features a <strong>ball pit</strong>, <strong>slides</strong>, a <strong>small maze structure</strong>, and a <strong>trampoline</strong> at the very back.<br />
Kids love climbing up and down the slides and maze repeatedly — perfect for tiring them out 😆</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabySwing.png" alt="Swings" /><br />
<em>(Located near the trampoline area; another swing can be found behind the rainbow slide.)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, there are <strong>two swings hanging under the maze</strong>,<br />
and many kids end up staying there for surprisingly long stretches of time!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-pretend-play-zone">🍳 Pretend Play Zone</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyPretend.png" alt="Pretend play area" /><br />
<em>(Our kid’s favorite — the kitchen play zone!)</em></p>

<p>The right side is quieter, filled with <strong>role-play setups</strong> like<br />
a <strong>kitchen</strong>, <strong>supermarket</strong>, <strong>doctor’s office</strong>, <strong>princess room</strong>, and <strong>fire station</strong>.</p>

<p>Some toys are missing or slightly worn out —<br />
but the <strong>kitchen and supermarket areas</strong> are still in good condition,<br />
and there’s a nice selection of <strong>dresses and costumes</strong> that keep kids entertained for a while.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-rest-area--party-room">☕ Rest Area &amp; Party Room</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyHallWay.png" alt="Hallway" /><br />
<em>(The hallway between the active and pretend play zones — follow it to reach the rest area.)</em></p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251017/HanaBabyRestArea.png" alt="Rest area" /></p>

<p>Down the hallway, there’s a <strong>rest area with a restroom</strong> and a <strong>birthday party room</strong>.<br />
This part is both the <strong>strength and weakness</strong> of the playground.<br />
There’s only <strong>one restroom</strong>, which can be inconvenient,<br />
but <strong>outside food is allowed</strong>, making it a comfortable space for snacks or meals.<br />
You’ll even see some parents working on their laptops here while their kids play nearby.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-parking--nearby-food-options">🚗 Parking &amp; Nearby Food Options</h3>

<p>Since HANABaby is located <strong>inside Royal City Centre Mall</strong>,<br />
you get <strong>3 hours of free parking</strong>.<br />
If you purchase the all-day pass, you’ll need to pay for extra time after 3 hours.</p>

<p>Inside the mall, you’ll find <strong>A&amp;W</strong>,<br />
and just outside are <strong>McDonald’s, Save-On-Foods, and Walmart</strong> —<br />
making it super easy to grab food or snacks to bring back to the rest area.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-overall-impression">🧒 Overall Impression</h3>

<p>Overall, HANABaby Adventure World is best suited for <strong>younger kids (ages 2–4)</strong><br />
and especially for <strong>girls</strong>, since the pretend play area takes up a large portion of the space.<br />
It’s not huge, but considering there aren’t many similar indoor playgrounds<br />
around <strong>New Westminster or Burnaby</strong>,<br />
this one feels like a <strong>real gem on a rainy day</strong> ☔</p>

<p>📍 <strong>Location:</strong> 328-4949 Canoe Pass Way, Tsawwassen, BC V4M 0B2<br />
💰 <strong>Price:</strong> 1 Child + 1 Adult → $25.99 + GST<br />
⏰ <strong>Playtime:</strong> Unlimited on weekdays, 2-hour limit on weekends</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-layout-overview">🎡 Layout Overview</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/SimpleMap.png" alt="Simplified Floor Map" /><br />
(This is a simplified floor map I drew myself — not to scale.)</p>

<p>As of 2025, the play center is divided into three main zones:<br />
1️⃣ <strong>Main Play Area</strong> (included with admission)<br />
2️⃣ <strong>Add-on Zone 1: Rainbow Haven</strong><br />
3️⃣ <strong>Add-on Zone 2: Ninja Jump</strong></p>

<p>The main play area alone is more than enough for most kids.<br />
If it’s your first visit, there’s really no need to pay for the add-ons right away.<br />
(Of course, the owner will recommend them — just smile and say, “Next time, thank you 😊.”)</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-main-play-area-maze">🧩 Main Play Area (Maze)</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Maze.png" alt="Main Playground" /><br />
(This photo was taken from the back of the main area. You can find more photos on Google Maps reviews.)</p>

<p>The centerpiece is a massive <strong>maze-like play structure</strong> filled with slides in every direction.<br />
Each child finds their own favorite route through the tunnels and ramps.</p>

<p>Behind it, there’s a <strong>block-building zone</strong> and a small <strong>toddler-only area</strong> (for ages 3 and under).<br />
The toddler zone isn’t very large, so it may not be worth visiting just for that age group —<br />
but if you have siblings of different ages, it’s perfect for everyone to enjoy together.</p>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Block.png" alt="Block Zone" /><br />
(A quiet block-building area where kids can focus and play calmly.)</p>

<p>The facility has plenty of restrooms, and they’re kept very clean thanks to frequent staff checks.<br />
There’s also a <strong>bouncy castle section</strong>, where kids can literally jump until they run out of energy 😆</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-add-on-zone-1-rainbow-haven">🌈 Add-on Zone 1: Rainbow Haven</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Rainbow.png" alt="Rainbow Haven" /></p>

<p>This zone features a web-like climbing structure made of soft netting —<br />
something you might often see in Korean-style indoor playgrounds.<br />
My kids weren’t too interested in it, but some children loved it so much<br />
they stayed there almost the entire time.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-add-on-zone-2-ninja-jump">🧗 Add-on Zone 2: Ninja Jump</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Ninja.png" alt="Ninja Jump" /></p>

<p>This section includes trampolines, small climbing walls,<br />
and various <strong>balance challenge courses</strong> — perfect for energetic kids.</p>

<p>Our children absolutely loved it and spent most of their time here,<br />
burning off every bit of energy they had.</p>

<p>If your kids enjoy physical play, the add-on fee is totally worth it.<br />
But since these zones aren’t included in the base ticket,<br />
you can always explore first and decide later.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-café--rest-area">☕️ Café &amp; Rest Area</h3>

<p><img src="/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Table Area.png" alt="Rest Area" /><br />
(The kids in this photo have been removed with a photo tool, so you might notice some smudges.)</p>

<p>Food and drinks are only allowed in the <strong>designated dining area</strong> outside the play zone.<br />
Non-playing adults can also sit there to relax and keep an eye on the kids.</p>

<p>Outside food is allowed, and there are plenty of options nearby —<br />
<strong>A&amp;W, Firehouse Subs, and Starbucks</strong> are all within walking distance.<br />
One parent can even pop over to <strong>Tsawwassen Mills</strong> to grab snacks or meals.<br />
No worries — there’s no shortage of food around here!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-overall-impression">🧒🏻 Overall Impression</h3>

<p>Although <strong>FlyO’Land Kids’ Playcenter</strong> inside Tsawwassen Mills is more well-known,<br />
I personally preferred <strong>Wonderland Kids Indoor Play Center</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s especially great for kids who love running and climbing.<br />
The maze is big and open enough that <strong>parents can join in easily</strong> —<br />
which isn’t always the case in many other indoor playgrounds.</p>

<p>Because it’s spacious, the air circulation feels much better too.</p>

<p>I’d honestly call this one of the <strong>best indoor playgrounds in the Greater Vancouver area</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>MetroMama</name></author><category term="indoor" /><category term="tsawwassen" /><category term="kids-cafe" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[🏰 Visit to Wonderland Kids Indoor Play Center]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://vanmom.senapress.com/en/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Wonderland.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://vanmom.senapress.com/en/en/assets/img/2025/20251008/Wonderland.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
